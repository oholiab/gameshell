# gameshell

Just a little project to make an interactive and easily expandable text
adventure using clojure, potentially for use as a logic backend for a graphical
game. This project is primarily me poking around in Clojure to see what it can
do, and also experimentation in lisp-a-likes and functional programming.

## Installation

Built using lein, `lein uberjar` in the root of the project should build you a
jar which you should be able to use in the manner shown below *if* it's at a
buildable stage.

## Usage

    $ java -jar gameshell-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

None.

## Examples

Really lein? Are you honestly generating all this markdown for me to fill out? I
just want to be able to access my terrible code on goathub :(

### Bugs

It doesn't work and I don't really know Clojure.

### Any Other Sections
### That You Think
### Might be Useful
None thanks
